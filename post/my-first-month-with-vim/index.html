<p>Today celebrates my first month with vim.</p>

<p>It also marks the first time I did a custom configuration on my <code>.vimrc</code>. When I said &lsquo;custom&rsquo; it means that it was not just some snippet I found from the internet, it was an actual, personal configuration that made &lsquo;vim&rsquo; my own flavor of &lsquo;vim&rsquo;. This, I think, is the point when someone can say they have graduated from vim noob, to vim user.</p>

<h1 id="hipster-coding">Hipster Coding</h1>

<p>Vim is <em>the</em> editor. Not just any editor. <strong>THE</strong> editor. You know for <a href="https://xkcd.com/378/">real programmers</a></p>

<p>Just a couple of months ago I made the switch from Windows to OSX, biting the bullet and buying myself a 13&rdquo; rMBP. I&rsquo;ve come to enjoy the transition thus far, finally having the versatility of UNIX on my machine.</p>

<p>The more than positive experience of switching OS made me want to experiment with my tools more, and seeing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTqZNujQOlA">Jonathan Blow programming on Emacs</a> inspired me to switch to these classic editors. I already used Emacs back in the day, and while it is a good editor, I was looking for something a little more lightweight and nimble. Working with Javascript most of the time, I would much prefer a speedy editor like Vim against fancy IDE features that Emacs could offer.</p>

<h1 id="the-learning-curve-and-progressive-hacking">The Learning Curve and Progressive Hacking</h1>

<p>I was intimidated at first. Vim is well known to have a pretty brutal learning curve, and I had contracts whose deadlines won&rsquo;t extend to account for me learning a new editor. This was a potential show-stopper right from the get go.</p>

<figure >  <img src="http://arianv.com/media/images/editor-learning-curve.png" alt="This image is as classic as the editors themselves" style=""/>  <figcaption> <p> This image is as classic as the editors themselves   </p> </figcaption> </figure>

<p>I figured though - when would I ever just commit to learning vim? I&rsquo;ve programmed enough to know that perfect opportunities to learn things never really present themselves, so I decided to learn it just like how one would learn a new framework or language, by <em>just effin&rsquo; using it</em></p>

<p>My vim story started by me using vim just like how I would use any other editor. My first day was spent scrolling around and clicking on things, all to no avail (I was running on a terminal, and vim doesn&rsquo;t support mouse events by default). I pretty much never touched normal mode at all, spending most of my time in insert mode and moving along with the arrow keys. Searching for a string in my project involved a (rather pathethic) workflow of having sublime text running in the background, where I could quickly use &lsquo;find in files&rsquo; in the familiar GUI.</p>

<p>After a few days, I switched from using cursor keys to <code>hjkl</code> keys, and I learned how to use <code>:edit</code> to switch files without closing and reoping vim all the time. Eventually I installed my first ever plugin, <code>NERDTree</code> which added the much needed file navigation system.</p>

<p>You see, I made it a point to progressively learn vim, and that involved grabbing packages and learning things only when I found that I &lsquo;needed&rsquo; them.</p>

<p>This philosophy pretty much defined how I learned vim. Editing properties in <code>json</code> files made me learn <code>ci</code>, and looking into more efficient insert commands made me learn <code>o</code>, <code>I</code>, and <code>A</code>. Maintaining a javascript codebase with variable indent widths made me learn the very first big trick that made me go wow - <code>gg=G</code> (indent the whole file). The idea that the whole thing relies on individual commands made it more awesome - <code>gg</code> goes to the start of the file, <code>=</code> indents, and <code>G</code> goes to the end of the file. After learning that, I found myself using <code>=</code> more, such as with <code>v</code> and <code>%</code></p>

<p>Vim had an admittedly steep learning curve, but I don&rsquo;t really think it is as hard as a lot of people claim it to be, as long as you take it in incrementally. I found it only a little bit harder to use than a &lsquo;dumb editor&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s more complicated features hidden around esoteric commands, waiting for you to discover them.</p>

<p>Eventually, as I got more comfortable with vim, I went on adding more features that I needed through plugins one by one.</p>

<p>As a slave to aesthetics, the second plugin (which is really a theme) that I added is the Solarized theme. This also made me switch to iTerm, which, apart from supporting 256 colors, also had an excellent show/hide feature that can be keybound. This, with iTerm&rsquo;s (also keybind-able) fullscreen feature gave me an unparalleled productivity boost.</p>

<p>YouCompleteMe provided some much needed auto complete. Fugitive was used for Git, and I finally learned how to use Ack to search for things. Linters? Syntastic. Code expand? Emmet. Et cetera, et cetera.</p>

<p>I found my slow growth of skill in vim incredibly exciting. Eventually, I found myself more productive than my previous Atom/Sublime using self.</p>

<p>I can definitely see it as one of the best investments I ever made.</p>
