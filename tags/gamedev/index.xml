      <description>An alien with an insatiable appetiate has attacked your camp. Satiate its cravings using any means necessary&amp;hellip; Even if it means sacrificing your people
 Space - follow (when near person) Z - assign to building (when near building) X - remove all current followers  TIPS:
 Game ramps up in difficulty. Plan accordingly Make propaganda towers to increase human count, then dispensers to allow more to be processed, then hospitals to decrease effects of stress A dispenser produces 50 food and 10 seconds to process.</description>

      <description>Ludum Dare is a recurring accelerated video game development event. It is a hackathon-like competition where participants can join a compo (one person creating a game in 48 hours) or the more casual jam (72 hours with optional team members)
I haven&amp;rsquo;t made games for quite some time now, focusing mainly on ReactJS and Web Development, so I thought it was a perfect time to join. While I have a lot of experience programming and joining accelerated development events (winning quite a few in the process), creating a game where I was responsible for everything (I usually work with a team of artists/musicians/etc) would be quite a challenge.</description>
