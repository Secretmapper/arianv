      <description>In my CS 180 (Artificial Intelligence class), I was tasked to implement search algorithms for pathfinding. This post series is a direct conversion of the jupyter notebooks for that project.
The jupyter notebooks can be found online here
CS 180 Artificial Intelligence&amp;#182;Machine Problem 1: Path Planning&amp;#182;In this machine problem, we are tasked with implementing search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*) to find the shortest path (any path in the case of DFS) between two points on a plane that has polygonal obstacles.</description>
