      <description>Excellent Communicator
I&amp;rsquo;m a very chill guy to talk to, and I always try to put myself in other people&amp;rsquo;s shoes.
I write technical articles aimed at the general audience, which have been very well received on sites such as GameDev.net and Gamasutra.
I also maintain my own blog at arianv.com
  &amp;ldquo;Super talented and hard working. Also a super friendly guy who is a frequent communicator.&amp;rdquo; Daniel Stone (Client)   &amp;ldquo;Keep up the good work!</description>

      <description>In Journey East, I was tasked to learn a language I&amp;rsquo;m unfamiliar with (Java) and learn how to develop APIs in a short amount of time so I could be brought to work on the server.
 Spontaneous and Fast Learner
I&amp;rsquo;m a self starter, and thrive in fast-paced, dynamic environments.
I have a knack for learning new technologies in short periods of time.
