  <h1>Excellent Communicator</h1>

  I'm a very chill guy to talk to, and I always try to put myself in other people's shoes.

  I write technical articles aimed at the general audience, which have been very well received on sites such as <a href="http://gamedev.net">GameDev.net</a> and <a href="http://gamasutra.com">Gamasutra</a>.

  I also maintain my own blog at <a href="http://arianv.com">arianv.com</a>
